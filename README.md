## Introduction

The data for this project looks at activity levels from a personal monitoring device, which collected the number of steps taken at a 5-minute interval for October and November 2012.

This repo contains a data analysis of the activity levels by: 

* analyzing the mean total of numbers of steps taken each day 

* finding the average daily activity pattern

* tidying the data by replacing missing values with the average values of each time interval over the two months 

* comparing activity levels on weekends versus weekdays 

## Data

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this
dataset.
